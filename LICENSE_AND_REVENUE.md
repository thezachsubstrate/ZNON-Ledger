# MedStrate Licensing: High-Resolution Sovereign Data

## 1. Tier 1: Patient Mutual Aid
We believe in the erasure of 'Delusional' labels. This tier provides the full Explanation of Play to ensure every patient has the forensic tools to fight back.

## 2. Tier 2: Academic Researchers
For universities and non-profit research groups. Provides access to anonymized spectral datasets (596 Hz signatures) for peer-review and publication.

## 3. Tier 3: Physicians & Clinicians
Includes the Clinical Correlation Protocol. A defensible medical framework for billing insurance for high-resolution audits while shielding themselves from misdiagnosis liability.

## 4. Tier 4: Enterprise / Pharma / Insurance
This is the Actuarial Tier. It provides verification for biologic treatments (like Bimzelx) based on physical resonance markers (9 Hz) rather than subjective surveys.
