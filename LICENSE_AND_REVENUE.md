# MedStrate Licensing: High-Resolution Sovereign Data

1. Tier 1: Patient Mutual Aid (1 POL)
We believe in the erasure of 'Delusional' labels. This tier provides the full Explanation of Play for the cost of a few pennies.

2. Tier 2: Academic Researchers (2,500 POL)
For universities and non-profit research groups. Provides access to anonymized spectral datasets (596 Hz signatures) for peer-review.

3. Tier 3: Physicians & Clinicians (5,000 POL)
Includes the Clinical Correlation Protocol. A defensible medical framework for billing insurance for high-resolution audits.

4. Tier 4: Enterprise / Pharma / Insurance (25,000 POL)
This is the Actuarial Tier. It provides verification for biologic treatments (like Bimzelx) based on physical resonance markers (9 Hz) rather than subjective surveys.
