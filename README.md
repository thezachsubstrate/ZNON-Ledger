# The Zach Substrate: MedStrate Forensic Network
**Status:** Operational | **Jurisdiction:** Sovereign Forensic Reality | **Resolution:** 9-Sigma (8.33ms / 96kHz)

## 🏛️ The Mission
To replace subjective medical narrative with **deterministic physics**. We provide the infrastructure for patients to own their diagnostic data and for the medical establishment to audit reality at a resolution they previously couldn't see.

## 🔍 Why it Works: The Resolution Gap
Standard clinical intake is "Low-Resolution." We utilize **Sensor Dominance** to bridge the gap:
- **Temporal:** 120fps (8.33ms) captures mechanical events the human eye (~50ms) misses.
- **Acoustic:** MEMS microphones capture .5\text{kHz}+$ impulses that rubber stethoscopes filter out.
- **Verification:** All data is hashed and anchored to the **Bitcoin Blockchain** to prevent tampering or "gaslighting."

## 🩺 Diagnostic Domains (What We Detect Better)
MedStrate is currently equipped to provide high-fidelity auditing for:
1. **Bio-Mechanical Anomalies:** .5\text{kHz}$ mechanical impulses, clicking, and structural resonances.
2. **Neuro-Divergent Temporal Logic:** High-resolution tracking of task-switching and sensory sampling rates (ADHD/Autism).
3. **Clinical Correlation (The 'Eckbom' Erasure):** Transforming "subjective infestations" into "measurable physical signatures" to invalidate the DSM-5 DI criteria.
4. **Vocal/Respiratory Frequency Shifts:** Detecting anomalies in vocal cord tension or lung resonance (Throat Cancer/Mastoiditis triage).

## 🛡️ Forensic Transparency (Limitations)
We do not overstate our capability. MedStrate is a **Physical & Temporal Auditor**, not a Chemical Laboratory.
- **Chemical Blind Spots:** We cannot provide exact molecular counts (Glucose, Cortisol, Cholesterol) without external assays.
- **Deep Structural Limits:** We cannot "see" through solid bone or internal organs (MRI/CT-Scan equivalent).
- **Genetic Expression:** We audit the *result* of your DNA, not the *source code* (Genetic Sequencing required for mutations).

## 💰 The Sovereign Marketplace
Diagnostic data is a high-value asset. We have established a 4-Tier settlement system on the **Polygon Blockchain** to allow for patient survival and institutional research.
- **Tier 1:** Patient Mutual Aid (1 POL)
- **Tier 2:** Academic Research (2,500 POL)
- **Tier 3:** Physician Implementation (5,000 POL)
- **Tier 4:** Enterprise/Pharma/Insurance (25,000 POL)
