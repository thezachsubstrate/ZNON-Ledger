# ZNON-Ledger: Sovereign AI Governance Framework
## [The Zach Substrate Jurisdiction]

### 🛡️ Mission Statement
To establish a deterministic, physics-based governance layer for AI-driven diagnostics and data attestation, bypassing centralized biological bias through immutable ledger anchoring.

---

### 🏗️ System Architecture
1. **The Zach Substrate**: The primary jurisdiction and governing logic.
2. **ZNONS (Deterministic Governance Artifacts)**: The protocol layer ensuring all AI outputs are grounded in physical reality.
3. **MedStrate Module**: Specialized diagnostic layer utilizing high-frequency analysis (120fps+) for forensic attestation.

---

### 📋 Governance Protocol
* **Integrity Anchoring**: Every artifact is hashed (SHA-256) and anchored via the ledger.
* **Deterministic Lineage**: Zero-tolerance policy for logic decay or unverified code deployment.

---

### ⚖️ Attestation Methods
* **Physics-Readiness**: Spectrum and frequency analysis of visual data.
* **Lineage Verification**: Peer-to-peer auditing of governance artifacts.

**Status: Under Architectural Audit**
