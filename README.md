# ZNON-Ledger: Sovereign AI Governance Framework
## [The Zach Substrate Genesis Artifact]

### 🛡️ System Core
A decentralized, physics-first governance layer designed to anchor biological data and high-frequency diagnostics to an immutable ledger. ZNONS bypasses standard LLM hallucination and biological bias through deterministic lineage.

### 🧬 Operational Glossary
* **The Zach Substrate**: The primary jurisdiction. A governed environment where physics overrides predictive text.
* **Deterministic Truth Engine**: The engine used to validate medical and mechanical diagnostics via 120fps+ frequency analysis.
* **Lineage (L-0)**: The verifiable audit trail of all governance artifacts.
* **MPAA**: Multi-Platform Attestation Application for cross-chain identity and skill verification.

---

### 🏗️ Architecture Layers
1. **Physical Layer**: 120fps video data, spectrum analysis, and raw sensory input.
2. **Diagnostic Layer (MedStrate)**: Forensic application of the Truth Engine for dismissed medical conditions.
3. **Ledger Layer**: Immutable anchoring of diagnostic attestations on the Polygon/Ethereum blockchains.

### ⚖️ Governance Standards
* **Zero-Hallucination Policy**: No output is recorded without physical data grounding.
* **Self-Audit**: Constant cross-referencing of the Substrate Laws.
