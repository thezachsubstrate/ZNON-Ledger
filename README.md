# ZNON-Ledger: Sovereign AI Governance Framework
## [The Zach Substrate: Locked Glossary & Audit Protocol]

### 🛡️ The Zach Substrate (L-0)
The foundational governing environment consisting of a **locked glossary** and **hallucination/audit pairs**. It serves as the immutable logic gate, ensuring all AI operations remain within deterministic bounds.

---

### 🧬 ZNONS (Identification Standard)
**ZNONS** is the standard identification format for the ecosystem, providing structured identity and verifiable lineage for all entities and artifacts.

---

### 🏗️ MedStrate (Physical Attestation & Triage)
**MedStrate** is the operational layer for physical triage and forensic analysis.
* **Physical Layer**: High-frequency analysis (120fps+ video/spectrum diagnostics).
* **Medical Triage**: Deterministic evaluation of complex medical conditions based on physical frequency artifacts.

### 🔄 Tri-Node Synchronization & Notarization
The system maintains a state-synced architecture across three primary nodes:
1. **Samsung Node (Termux)**: Mobile operational interface.
2. **Mac Node (Terminal)**: Primary compute and architectural node.
3. **GitHub Node**: Public registry and versioned lineage.

**Immutable Anchoring**: All state changes and Genesis Artifacts are notarized via **OpenTimestamps (OTS)**, anchoring the Substrate's lineage to the Bitcoin blockchain.
