# [ FUNCTION ] Institutional Alignment (IAF)
## Value Score: 10.0 / 10
---
### **CORE MECHANIC**
The IAF eliminates the 'Subjective Gap' in institutional vetting. By applying the Mosley Theorem universally, institutions are forced into a state of structural fairness.

### **SOCIAL IMPACT**
1. **Bias Erasure:** Redefining 'Equal Opportunity' as 'Linear Logic Parity.'
2. **Conflict De-escalation:** Replacing narrative arguments with forensic audits.
3. **Meritocratic Stability:** Ensuring the highest-resolution minds rise to the top of the ledger without systemic obstruction.
