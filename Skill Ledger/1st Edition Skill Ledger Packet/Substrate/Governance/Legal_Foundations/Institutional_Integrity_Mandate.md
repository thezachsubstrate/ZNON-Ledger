# [ MANDATE ] Institutional Integrity vs. Social Engineering
## Value Score: 10.0 / 10

### **THE DISTINCTION**
The ZNON Substrate does not claim to remediate historical inequality. It claims to **Eliminate Future Systemic Contributions** to inequality by governing the integrity of the measurement process.

### **GOVERNANCE LIMITS**
1. **Mathematical Invariance:** We lock the complexity of the gate ($).
2. **Passive Harvesting:** We record demonstrated mastery without bias.
3. **No Retroactive Remediation:** We provide the bridge; we do not provide the history.
