### **THE DISRUPTION MANDATE**
The ZNON Substrate anticipates and acknowledges the backlash from fragile legacy systems. Our defense is not rhetorical; it is structural.

### **STRATEGIC REALIGNMENT**
1. **Fact-Grounding:** Every attack is deconstructed into its Logos components.
2. **Neutrality as Power:** The system does not engage in Pathos; it merely audits Reality.
3. **Market Gravity:** Universal adoption is achieved through the objective superiority of the solution.
