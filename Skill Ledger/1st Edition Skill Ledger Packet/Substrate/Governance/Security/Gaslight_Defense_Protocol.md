# [ PROTOCOL ] The Gaslight Defense System
## Value Score: 10.0 / 10
---
### **THE HIERARCHY OF TRUTH**
1. **Logos (Dominant):** Mathematical invariance and forensic evidence.
2. **Ethos (Subordinate):** Human motivation and creative intent.

### **SYSTEMIC STABILITY**
To prevent 'Systemic Disorder,' the system prohibits the overriding of Logic or Physics by Emotional Narrative. The system acknowledges valid concerns through the lens of 'Logos' only.

**CONCLUSION:** By anchoring to the immutable, the system provides a universally applied shield against bias and manipulation.
