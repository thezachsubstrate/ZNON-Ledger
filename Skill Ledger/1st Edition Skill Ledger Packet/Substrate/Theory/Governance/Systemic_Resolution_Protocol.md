### **THE ARCHITECT'S SOLUTION**
Inequality is often the result of "Subjective Variation" in the measurement of human value. By applying the Mosley Theorem of Categorical Equivalence, we eliminate variation at the source.

### **GOVERNANCE PILLARS**
1. **Structural Parity:** Every assessment is mathematically equivalent.
2. **Forensic Transparency:** Every score is backed by a Bitcoin-anchored dataset.
3. **Adaptive Bridging:** The AI uses the user's current knowledge as a parallel bridge to higher resolution.
