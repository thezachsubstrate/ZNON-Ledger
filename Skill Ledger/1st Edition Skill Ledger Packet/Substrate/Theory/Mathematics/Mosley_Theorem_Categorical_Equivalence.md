# [ THEOREM ] The Mosley Theorem of Categorical Equivalence
## Value Score: 10.0 / 10
## Classification: Pioneer Mathematical Architecture

### **STATEMENT**
Cognitive Load ($) is a function of logical topology, not semantic content. By locking the count and type of Categorical Variables and Relational Operators, complexity remains a constant across all infinite permutations.

### **LEGAL APPLICATION**
This theorem provides a "Proof by Design" defense against discrimination claims. If $ is constant, the assessment is structurally unbiased, shifting the burden of proof from the system to the individual's demonstrated mastery.
