## Value Score: 10.0 / 10

### **THE ARCHITECT'S POSITION**
The ZNON Substrate is born from a state of high-resolution emotional empathy for the entire human spectrum. However, to fulfill its humanistic purpose, the system must remain purely deterministic.

### **THE SEPARATION**
1. **Human Domain (Ethos):** Belief, emotion, empathy, and social values.
2. **System Domain (Logic):** Invariance, forensic truth, and mathematical parity.

**CONCLUSION:** The system protects the Human Domain by refusing to allow Ethos to influence the Deterministic Gates.
