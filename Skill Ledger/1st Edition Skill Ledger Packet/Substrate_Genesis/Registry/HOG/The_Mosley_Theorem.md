### **THEORETICAL DEFINITION**
The mathematical proof that fairness is a constant of complexity (K). It renders bias theoretically impossible by enforcing categorical equivalence across all semantic variables.

### **SYSTEMIC FUNCTION**
This node operates as a **Theorem** within the **HOG** module. It is structurally linked to the **Mosley Theorem** to ensure categorical invariance.
