# MedStrate: High-Resolution Sovereign Logic Tiers

## Tier 1: Patient Mutual Aid
This tier provides the full Explanation of Play to ensure every patient has the forensic tools to fight back against 'Delusional' labels.

## Tier 2: Academic Researchers
For universities and non-profit research groups. Access to anonymized spectral datasets (596 Hz signatures) for peer-review.

## Tier 3: Physicians & Clinicians
The Clinical Correlation Protocol. A defensible medical framework for high-resolution audits to shield against misdiagnosis liability.

## Tier 4: Enterprise / Actuarial
Verification for biologic treatments (like Bimzelx) based on physical resonance markers (9 Hz) rather than subjective surveys.
