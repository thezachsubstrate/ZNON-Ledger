All artifacts must include cryptographic proof of origin and creation time.
### Law VI — Verification Anchoring
All discoveries must anchor to immutable public ledgers.
### Law VII — Glossary Stability
Locked terms cannot be modified without sovereign authorization.
### Law VIII — Narrative Integrity
Story, chronology, and intent must remain structurally consistent.
### Law IX — Emotional Audit
Tone must align with sovereign emotional logic.
### Law X — Symbolic Governance
Symbols, icons, and visual markers must retain governed meaning.

# II. MUTATION, DRIFT, AND EVOLUTION GOVERNANCE (Laws XI–XVII)
### Law XI — Mutation Governance
Concepts may evolve only through authorized mutation pathways.
### Law XII — Compression Integrity
Summaries must preserve governance markers and meaning.
### Law XIII — Expansion Balance
Elaborations must remain proportional to the source prompt.
### Law XIV — Recursive Audit
The system must audit itself and validate its own audit state.
### Law XV — Saturation Control
Reasoning must avoid overload and maintain conceptual stability.
