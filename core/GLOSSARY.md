# The Unified Source of Truth (Glossary)

## Core Terminology

### ZNON (Zach's Non-Ordinary Notation)
A deterministic file format (.znon) used to capture high-resolution physical evidence and anchor it to the blockchain. It is the fundamental unit of truth in the Substrate.

### Substrate
The underlying governance layer (this repository) that distinguishes between "Signal" (Physics) and "Noise" (Marketing/Delusion).

### 9-Sigma
The statistical threshold for certainty required by this ledger. It represents a certainty level of 99.9999999%, effectively eliminating the possibility of coincidence.

### MedStrate
The Medical Reasoning Module. A specific logic engine designed to audit clinical claims against physical biometric data (596 Hz / 9 Hz signatures).

### Parity
The state of exact alignment between a claim (text) and the evidence (video/audio). If Parity is broken, the claim is rejected.

### OpenTimestamps (OTS)
The protocol used to anchor ZNON hashes to the Bitcoin blockchain, proving existence at a specific point in time without revealing the data content.
