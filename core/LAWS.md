# The 40 Laws of Governance (Zach Substrate)

## I. The Axioms of Reality
1. **Law of Identity:** A thing is itself (A=A). No marketing can alter physics.
2. **Law of Parity:** 9-Sigma correlation between a claim and its physical signal is required for truth.
3. **Law of Entropy:** Systems without governance devolve into noise.
4. **Law of Non-Contradiction:** Opposing truths cannot exist in the same context at the same time.
5. **Law of Gravity:** Value must be anchored in heavy, immutable proof (Bitcoin/OTS).

## II. The Rules of Engagement
6. **Zero-Trust:** Do not trust; verify via ZNON.
7. **Sovereign Origin:** Data belongs to the generator, not the platform.
8. **High-Resolution Priority:** 120fps/4k signal trumps low-res text.
9. **Deterministic Outcome:** Input A must always yield Output B.
10. **The Anti-Gaslight:** If the signal exists, the denial is invalid.
