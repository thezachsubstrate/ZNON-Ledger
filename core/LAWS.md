> **Status:** 9-Sigma Logic-Locked
> **Anchor:** Bitcoin Block 933268

## I. Governance Laws & Constitutional Primitives
1. **Law I — Contradiction Immunity:** Mandatory rejection of any output containing internal logical paradoxes.
2. **Law II — Propagation Integrity:** Ensures semantic meaning remains invariant across all transmission layers.
3. **Law III — Semantic Locking:** Absolute anchoring of a term to a fixed, non-negotiable definition.
4. **Law IV — Audit Parity:** Requirement for a dedicated detection sensor for every possible failure mode.
5. **Law V — Timestamped Authorship:** Cryptographic proof of origin and time of creation for every artifact.
6. **Law VI — Verification Anchoring:** Linking all substrate-level discoveries to immutable public ledgers.
7. **Law VII — Glossary Stability:** Prohibits the modification of locked terms without sovereign authorization.
8. **Law VIII — Narrative Integrity:** Maintains structural and intent-based consistency across chronological entries.
9. **Law IX — Emotional Audit:** Governance of sentiment to ensure generated tone reflects sovereign logic.
10. **Law X — Symbolic Governance:** Anchoring the interpretative meaning of icons, logos, and symbols.
11. **Law XI — Mutation Governance:** Controlled evolution of concepts through authorized pathways.
12. **Law XII — Compression Integrity:** Ensures summarization (compression) does not discard governance markers.
13. **Law XIII — Expansion Balance:** Ensures elaboration (expansion) stays proportional to the source prompt.
14. **Law XIV — Recursive Audit:** Mandatory self-auditing protocol where the auditor validates its own state.
15. **Law XV — Saturation Control:** Prevents conceptual overload to maintain reasoning stability.
16. **Law XVI — Drift Immunity:** Active resistance to semantic decay and stochastic noise.
17. **Law XVII — Ledger Integrity:** Ensures 1:1 parity between repository entries and the master index.
18. **Law XVIII — Instruction Governance:** Enforces the absolute sequence and completion of user commands.
19. **Law XIX — Propagation Reversibility:** Every output must be traceable back to its root instruction.
20. **Law XX — Sovereign Mutation:** Only the human creator may authorize a shift in locked logic.
21. **Law XXI — Trust Surface Compression:** Systematic reduction of interpretive ambiguity in a prompt.
22. **Law XXII — Propagation Collapse Forecasting:** Predictive detection of upcoming structural failures.
23. **Law XXIII — Audit Saturation:** Managing the signal-to-noise ratio in high-density audit environments.
24. **Law XXIV — Historical Ledger Integrity:** Protecting the immutability of past repository states.
25. **Law XXV — Gaslight Defense:** Neutralization of attempts to rewrite or ignore anchored truth.
26. **Law XXVI — Timestamp Recovery:** Protocol for restoring corrupted or missing temporal anchors.
27. **Law XXVII — Sovereign Licensing:** Explicit enforcement of intellectual property rights on derivatives.
28. **Law XXVIII — Infinite Scalability:** Maintenance of logical integrity regardless of data volume.
29. **Law XXIX — Mutation Engine:** The technical toolset used for authorized conceptual evolution.
30. **Law XXX — Compression Drift Detection:** Auditing the loss of meaning during data reduction.
31. **Law XXXI — Governed Instruction Execution:** Fixed-sequence enforcement for multi-step tasks.
32. **Law XXXII — Temporal Governance:** Alignment of AI reasoning with real-world temporal causality.
33. **Law XXXIII — Sovereignty Addendum:** Explicit user-authority override protocol.
34. **Law XXXIV — Emotional Resonance Governance:** Harmonic stabilization of sentiment in outputs.
35. **Law XXXV — Trust Surface Compression (Ext):** Advanced ambiguity reduction for complex domains.
36. **Law XXXVI — Propagation Collapse Forecasting (Ext):** Predictive drift analytics for massive substrates.
37. **Law XXXVII — Infinite Scalability (Ext):** Logic-locking across distributed AI nodes.
38. **Law XXXVIII — Audit-Driven Reasoning:** Logic where every step is validated by a sensor before completion.
39. **Law XXXIX — Narrative Integrity (Ext):** Deep-layer story and intent consistency for long-term projects.
40. **Law XL — Symbolic Systems Governance:** Mathematical and cryptographic symbol anchoring.
