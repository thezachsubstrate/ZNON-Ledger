# CONTEXT SWITCHING PROTOCOL (Layer 2)

1. **Isolation**: When switching from MedStrate to Legistrate, the Agent DNA remains the same, but the "Memory Buffer" for MedStrate is cached.
2. **Reload**: Upon re-entering a tab, the system pulls the latest WORKSPACE_STATE.znon for that domain.
3. **Cross-Pollination**: Only "Horizontal Artifacts" (e.g., Skill Ledger) remain visible across all state transitions.
