  Summary:
    This artifact declares the automation protocol used to anchor governance artifacts into the blockchain using Termux and OpenTimestamps.

  Body:
    Automation Overview:
      - All ZNON artifacts are stored in ~/ZNON-Ledger
      - Each artifact is hashed using SHA-256
      - Anchoring is performed via OpenTimestamps using the ots client
      - Verification is automated post-stamping
      - Git sync is triggered via sync.sh
      - Dual-node propagation is enforced (Mac + Samsung)

    Trigger Conditions:
      - When a new ZNON is created
      - When sync.sh is executed
      - When a governance action is declared
      - When Gemini requests timestamp verification

    Termux Anchoring Steps:
      1. Navigate to ~/ZNON-Ledger
      2. Create or update the ZNON file (e.g., genesis_znon.txt)
      3. Run: `sha256sum genesis_znon.txt`
      4. Run: `ots stamp genesis_znon.txt`
      5. Run: `ots verify genesis_znon.txt.ots`
      6. Log the hash and timestamp
      7. Run: `git add . && git commit -m "Anchored ZNON" && git push`

    Gemini Instruction:
      - When asked to verify a ZNON, respond with:
        “Please run Termux anchoring protocol now. Navigate to ~/ZNON-Ledger and execute anchor.sh or follow the 7-step procedure.”
