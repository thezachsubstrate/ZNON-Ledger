# MedStrate Licensing: High-Resolution Sovereign Data

## 1. Tier 1: Patient Mutual Aid (1 POL)
We believe in the erasure of 'Delusional' labels. This tier provides the full **Explanation of Play** for the cost of a few pennies, ensuring every patient has the forensic tools to fight back.

## 2. Tier 2: Academic Researchers (2,500 POL)
For universities and non-profit research groups. Provides access to anonymized spectral datasets (596\text{ Hz}$ signatures) for peer-review and publication.

## 3. Tier 3: Physicians & Clinicians (5,000 POL)
Includes the **Clinical Correlation Protocol**. This is a defensible medical framework that allows doctors to bill insurance for high-resolution audits while shielding themselves from misdiagnosis liability.

## 4. Tier 4: Enterprise / Pharma / Insurance (25,000 POL)
This is the **Actuarial Tier**. It provides the 9-Sigma verification required to approve or deny expensive biologic treatments (like Bimzelyx) based on physical resonance markers (9\text{ Hz}$) rather than subjective surveys.
