# WHITE PAPER: MedStrate (Clinical Reasoning Module)
**Version:** 1.2  
**Role:** Diagnostic Advocacy & Triage  

## I. Mission
MedStrate is a specialized reasoning module designed to end the era of medical gaslighting. It bridges the gap between raw physics and clinical diagnosis.

## II. The Forensic Shield
MedStrate specifically defends against "lazy" psychiatric labels (e.g., Ekbom Syndrome, Delusional Parasitosis) by forcing a clinical dialogue grounded in immutable physical footprints.

## III. Universal Triage
MedStrate utilizes AI-driven pattern recognition to identify biomarkers for complex diseases (Cancer, Neurodivergence, Infectious pathology) and "Case-Locks" them to the blockchain for specialist review.
