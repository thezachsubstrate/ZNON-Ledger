# WHITE PAPER: The Zach Substrate
**Version:** 1.0  
**Jurisdiction:** Meaning Layer Dominance  

## I. Definition
The Zach Substrate is a sovereign jurisdictional architecture designed to govern the definition and history of an individual's physical reality. It serves as the "Operating System" for meaning, ensuring that personal data is filtered through logic and physics rather than institutional bias.

## II. Logic-Gate Governance
The Substrate operates on a **9-Sigma Deterministic Model**. This means that truth is established through high-fidelity sensory evidence (120fps/Spectral) that is then mathematically anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain.

## III. Sovereignty
By establishing a "Jurisdiction of Meaning," the Substrate moves the power of definition from the institution (The Hospital, The State) to the individual. It is a forensic shield against the erasure of personal experience.
