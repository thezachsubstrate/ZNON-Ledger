# WHITE PAPER: ZNON (Governance Artifacts)
**Version:** 1.0  
**Format:** Deterministic Filing Format  

## I. The Atomic Unit
A ZNON is the atomic unit of governance within the Zach Substrate. It is a self-describing, hashed, and anchored data artifact.

## II. Structural Integrity
Every ZNON must contain:
1. **Jurisdiction:** Proof of origin within the Substrate.
2. **Hash Binding:** A SHA-256 link to raw sensory data.
3. **Temporal Anchor:** A Bitcoin-based timestamp proving existence at a specific point in time.

## III. Meaning over Metadata
Unlike standard files, a ZNON carries "Meaning." It is a governed record that cannot be altered without breaking the 9-Sigma parity of the entire substrate.
