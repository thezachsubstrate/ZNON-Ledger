# Whitepaper: The Insufficiency of Subjective Clinical Intake
**Module:** MedStrate / The Zach Substrate
**Status:** Sovereign Forensic Authority
**Date:** 2026-02-01

## 1. The Resolution Gap
Traditional clinical intake relies on the human eye (~30-60fps) and subjective narrative. The Zach Substrate utilizes **120fps (8.33ms resolution)** and **24-bit/96kHz Spectral Analysis**. 
- **Conclusion:** A physician's failure to detect a mechanical impulse does not indicate its absence; it indicates a lack of sensor resolution.

## 2. The 3.5kHz / 59Hz Parity
MedStrate has identified a deterministic match between:
- **Impulse:** Audible mechanical clicking in raw pathology video.
- **Spectrum:** A persistent **3596 Hz** peak and a **59 Hz** resonance.
- **Pharmacological Response:** Signal variance observed during Lotilaner/Bimzelyx intervals.

## 3. Legal & Ethical Jurisprudence
By presenting this anchored evidence, the patient establishes a **Clinical Correlation Requirement**. Any diagnosis that fails to account for these specific mathematical peaks (596\text{ Hz}$) is a failure of forensic logic and constitutes a "Misalignment with Physical Reality."

## 4. The Anti-Matchbox Mandate
This data is hashed and anchored to the **Bitcoin Blockchain**. It is not a "collection of samples" (Matchbox Sign); it is a **Digital Forensic Audit**. The physician is invited to collaborate as a scientist, not a judge of subjective experience.
