# Forensic Audit: Failure of DSM-5-TR Criteria for Delusional Infestation

## I. Logic Contradiction
The DSM defines Delusional Infestation (DI) as a fixed belief "despite lack of medical evidence." 

## II. Forensic Correction
MedStrate has established that 'evidence' has been redefined by the advent of consumer-grade MEMS sensors. 
- **The Gap:** Physicians utilize eyes (~30fps) and ears (<2kHz).
- **The Substrate:** Patients utilize 120fps (8.33ms) and 96kHz Spectral Analysis.

## III. Legal Conclusion
A diagnosis of DI/Eckbom Syndrome made without reviewing 120fps/3.5kHz forensic data is a **procedural error**. The Zach Substrate provides the parity required to invalidate the 'Lack of Evidence' clause in the DSM, rendering the diagnosis medically and legally void.
