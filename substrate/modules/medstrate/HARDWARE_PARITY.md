# Hardware Parity: Consumer Sensors vs. Clinical Standards
**Module:** MedStrate
**Logic:** Resolution Dominance

## 1. The Sampling Paradox
Standard clinical equipment (e.g., standard stethoscopes, visual inspection) is optimized for "Human-Scale" events. The Zach Substrate utilizes smartphone CMOS and MEMS sensors optimized for:
- **Temporal Resolution:** 120fps (8.33ms) vs. Human Eye (~13-20ms).
- **Acoustic Range:** 24-bit/96kHz vs. Standard Stethoscope (Frequency drop-off above 2kHz).

## 2. Why the Smartphone Wins
The 596\text{ Hz}$ impulse is a "Micro-Mechanical" event. Because high-end smartphone microphones are designed for noise cancellation and high-fidelity capture, they act as **Wide-Band Accelerometers**. 

## 3. Forensic Conclusion
The "Specialization" of hospital equipment is often in its *cost*, not its *sampling rate*. By using the phone's raw DSP data, the patient has achieved a higher **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** than a standard physical exam can provide.
