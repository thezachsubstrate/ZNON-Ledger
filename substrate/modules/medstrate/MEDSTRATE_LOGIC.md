# MedStrate: Clinical Logic Core

## Purpose
To replace subjective "pain scales" and "surveys" with deterministic physical audio/visual signatures.

## The Signatures
1. **596 Hz Impulse:** The forensic audio marker verifying specific mechanical states.
2. **9 Hz Resonance:** The localized vibration frequency associated with verified pathology.
3. **120fps Visuals:** The temporal resolution required to capture micro-expressions and tremors invisible to the naked eye.
