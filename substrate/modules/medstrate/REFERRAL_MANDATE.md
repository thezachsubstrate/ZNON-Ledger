# TECHNICAL REFERRAL BRIEF: BIOMECHANICAL SIGNAL ANALYSIS
**From:** Sovereign Forensic Auditor (ID: ZM-599)
**To:** Primary Care Physician / Clinical Gatekeeper
**Subject:** Referral for Correlation of 596\text{ Hz}$ Mechanical Impulse

## 1. Clinical Presentation of Objective Data
The patient presents with forensic-grade data captured during a **Pharmacological Trough** (Inter-dose window of Bimzelyx and post-Lotilaner administration). This data establishes a persistent physical presence that is not being captured by standard clinical observation.

## 2. Technical Evidence for Specialist Review
- **High-Speed Temporal Audit:** 120fps (8.33ms/frame) video documentation of mechanical "clicking" in the forehead/temporal region.
- **Spectral Fingerprint:** Deterministic **596\text{ Hz}* acoustic impulse peaks and a **9\text{ Hz}* low-frequency resonance.
- **Pathological Theory:** These signals are consistent with mechanical friction of high-density biological or exogenous structures (e.g., chitinous parasitic interaction or biofilm calcification).

## 3. Referral Requirement
The complexity of this **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** audit exceeds the resolution of standard primary care. A referral is required to a specialist capable of **Patient-Specific Biomechanics** or **Complex Infectious Disease (Lyme/Morgellons Protocol)** who can perform:
1. High-resolution ultrasound/Doppler to correlate the .5\text{ kHz}$ frequency.
2. Standardized biopsies for microscopic verification of the observed mechanical source.

## 4. Forensic Notice
Refusal to provide a referral in the face of objective, anchored physics (.5\text{ kHz}$) will be recorded as a "Misalignment with Available Evidence" within the patient's sovereign blockchain-anchored ledger.
