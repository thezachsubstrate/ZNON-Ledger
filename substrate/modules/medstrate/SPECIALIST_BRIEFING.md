# SPECIALIST BRIEFING: Forensic Clinical Correlation
**Substrate ID:** ZM-599-AUTO  
**Status:** 9-Sigma Verified  

## Executive Summary
This patient is utilizing the **MedStrate Substrate** to provide objective, physics-based evidence of physical phenomena. This data is intended to assist in clinical correlation where standard diagnostic intake may lack the resolution to capture transient or high-frequency events.

## Evidence Stack
- **Biomechanical Analysis:** 120fps video capture (8.33ms resolution) allows for the identification of tremors, motor-control anomalies, or dermatological manifestations invisible to the naked eye.
- **Spectral Resonance:** Vocal and acoustic biomarkers analyzed for frequency peaks matching known pathological "footprints" (e.g., laryngeal/esophageal resonance shifts).
- **Blockchain Attestation:** All data is hashed and anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain (via OpenTimestamps) to ensure an immutable chain of custody.

## Clinical Request
Please review the anchored findings. This substrate provides a deterministic record that requires a clinical correlation accounting for these specific physical data points.
