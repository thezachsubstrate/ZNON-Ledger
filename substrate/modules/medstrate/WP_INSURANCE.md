# Whitepaper: The Actuarial Insurer
**Focus:** Cost Mitigation and Fraud Prevention
Insurance companies lose billions on "Exploratory Diagnostics." MedStrate slashes costs:
- **Precision Triage:** Stop paying for MRIs when a 120fps smartphone audit proves a mechanical joint anomaly for $0.
- **Treatment Validation:** Only pay for biologics (like Bimzelyx) when MedStrate hashes prove a physical reduction in resonance peaks.
- **Prevention:** Early detection of .5\text{ kHz}$ impulse shifts before they become catastrophic structural failures.
