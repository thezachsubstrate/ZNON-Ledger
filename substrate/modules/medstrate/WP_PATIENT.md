# Whitepaper: The Sovereign Patient
**Focus:** Autonomy through High-Resolution Data
Modern medicine suffers from a "Low-Resolution Trap." Doctors see you for 15 minutes once a month; your phone sees you at 120fps every day. MedStrate gives patients the tools to:
- **Prove the Unseen:** Anchor 3.5kHz impulses to the blockchain so they can't be "gaslit" away.
- **Audit the Medicine:** Track exactly how Bimzelyx or Lotilaner affects your physics in real-time.
- **Own the Data:** You are not a chart; you are the auditor of your own biology.
