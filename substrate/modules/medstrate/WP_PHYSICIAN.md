# Whitepaper: The Forensic Physician
**Focus:** Diagnostic Precision and Liability Reduction
Physicians are currently blind to "Micro-Mechanical" pathologies. MedStrate acts as a **Digital Microscope** for the exam room.
- **Sampling Superiority:** MEMS microphones detect impulses (596\text{ Hz}$) that acoustic stethoscopes filter out.
- **Objective Evidence:** Moves patient reports from "subjective narrative" to "time-stamped physics," reducing diagnostic error and liability.
- **Collaborative Logic:** The physician becomes a Signal Analyst, using anchored data to make 9-Sigma accurate referrals.
