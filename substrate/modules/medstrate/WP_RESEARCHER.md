# Whitepaper: The Data Researcher
**Focus:** Longitudinal Real-World Evidence (RWE)
Clinical trials are expensive because data collection is manual. MedStrate provides:
- **High-Density Phenotyping:** 24/7 monitoring of neuro-divergent temporal resolution and pathological signatures.
- **Zero-Knowledge Research:** Researchers can purchase access to anonymized hashes of 120fps video to identify new disease markers without compromising HIPAA.
- **Deterministic Outcomes:** Real-time correlation of drug efficacy (e.g., IL-17A inhibition vs. 59Hz resonance).
